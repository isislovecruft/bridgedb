# Hashring Allocation Options   \

# Distributor, and another for the Email Distributor. In addition, an
# "Unallocated" hashring is always created, in order to reserve some portion
# of bridges for manual distribution, or as backup in the case of a major
# blocking event. Once a bridge is assigned to one of these allocation groups,
# it stays there; there is currently no mechanism for changing a bridge's
# hashring allocation.
#
# Once a bridge is assigned to either of the first two groups, it stays there
# persistently. The bridges are allocated to these groups in a proportion of
