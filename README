## BridgeDB [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isislovecruft/bridgedb/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/isislovecruft/bridgedb)
-----------

BridgeDB is a collection of backend servers used to distribute
[Tor Bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges). It currently consists
of a webserver with [an HTTPS interface](https://bridges.torproject.org), an
email responder, and an SQLite database.

#### What are Tor Bridges?
[Tor Bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) are special Tor relays
which are not listed in the public relay directory. They are used to help
circumvent [censorship](https://ooni.torproject.org) by providing users with
connections to the public relays in the Tor network.

Tor Bridges are different from normal relays in another important way: they
can run what are called *Pluggable* *Transports*.

#### What's a Pluggable Transport?
A
[Pluggable Transport](https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en)
is a program which is *pluggable* — meaning that it is meant to work with lots
of other anonymity and censorship circumvention software, not just Tor — and
is a *transport* — meaning that it transports your internet traffic, usually
in a way which makes it look different. For example,
[Obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en) is a
Pluggable Transport which disguises your traffic by adding an obfuscating
layer of encryption.

#### So how do I use this?
Well, probably, you don't. But if you're looking for bridges, you can use
[BridgeDB's web interface](https://bridges.torproject.org), which has
instructions on getting the Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle, as well
as instructions for getting extra Bridges.


## Maintainer Setup

### Dependencies and installation
BridgeDB requires the following OS-level dependencies:

 - python>=2.7
 - python-dev
 - build-essential
 - libgpgme11
 - libgpgme11-dev
 - OpenSSL>=1.0.1e
 - [SQLite3](http://www.maxmind.com/app/python)
 - [MaxMind GeoIP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing)
   - libgeoip-dev
   - geoip-database
 - [python-setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

As well as any Python dependencies in requirements.txt.

### Deploying BridgeDB

BridgeDB should work with or without a Python virtualenv.

 - Install Python 2.7, and other OS-level dependencies. On Debian, you can do:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl python python-dev \
            python-setuptools sqlite3 libgpgme11 libgpgme11-dev libgeoip-dev \
            geoip-database

 - Install Pip 1.3.1 or later. Debian has this version, but if for some reason
   that or a newer version isn't available, the easiest way to install a newer
   Pip is to use the Pip development teams's [getpip
   script](https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py):

        wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
        sudo python get-pip.py

 - (virtualenv installs only) Use Pip to install virtualenv and
   [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org):

        sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

 - (virtualenv installs only) Configure virtualenvwrapper and create a
   virtualenv for Bridgedb:

        WORKON_HOME=${HOME}/.virtualenvs
        export WORKON_HOME
        mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
        source $(which virtualenvwrapper.sh)
        git clone https://git.torproject.org/bridgedb.git && cd bridgedb
        mkvirtualenv -a $PWD -r requirements.txt --unzip-setuptools \
           --setuptools bridgedb
 
   From now on, to use BridgeDB's virtualenv, just do ```$ workon bridgedb```
   (after sourcing virtualenvwrapper.sh, as before). To exit the virtualenv
   without exiting the shell, do ```$ deactivate```.

 - (virtualenv installs only) To install, set PYTHONPATH to include the root
   directory of the virtualenv:

        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/python2.7/site-packages

 - Then proceed as usual:

        python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt

### Testing BridgeDB

To create a bunch of fake bridge descriptors to test BridgeDB, do:

        bridgedb mock [-n NUMBER_OF_DESCRIPTORS]

Then to run unittests, see the ```bridgedb test``` and ```bridgedb trial```
commands.

### Enabling additional features:

#### Translations

**Using New Translations**: This should be done when newly completed
  translations are available in Transifex.

Piece of cake. Running ```maint/get-completed-translations``` will take care
of cloning *only* the ```bridgedb_completed``` branch of Tor's
[translations repo](https://gitweb.torproject.org/translation.git) and placing
all the updated files in their correct locations.

**Requesting Translations for Altered/Added Source Code**: This should be done
  whenever any of the strings requiring translation -- _("they are formatted
  like this") -- are changed, or new ones are added. See
  ```lib/bridgedb/I18n.py```.

Translations for Tor Project repos are kept
[in a separate repo](https://gitweb.torproject.org/translation.git).  You'll
need to extract the strings from BridgeDB's source code into .pot templates,
and place these .po files into the ```translation``` repo in the
```bridgedb``` branch. After than the .po files should be put into Transifex
(don't ask me how this works…) and translated. After the translations are
complete, the finished .po files should be placed into the
```bridgedb_completed``` branch.

 - To extract all strings from BridgeDB's source:

       python setup.py extract_messages --input-dirs ./lib/bridgedb/templates

   A .pot file will be created in ./i18n/templates/bridgedb.pot

 - Initialise catalogs for each desired language:

       python setup.py init_catalog -l LANG

   where ```LANG``` is the 2 or 4 letter country-code, eg. 'es'. If you've
   already initialised a particular language, do instead:
      
      python setup.py update_catalog


#### Enabling HTTPS
Create a self-signed certificate with:

     maint/make-ssl-cert

Or, place an existing certificate in the path specified in bridgedb.conf by
the ```HTTPS_CERT_FILE``` option, and a private key where ```HTTPS_KEY_FILE```
points to. The defaults are 'cert' and 'privkey.pem', respectively.

#### CAPTCHAs
To enable Captchas on the webserver interface, set these options in
bridgedb.conf:

    RECAPTCHA_ENABLED
    RECAPTCHA_PUB_KEY
    RECAPTCHA_PRIV_KEY
    
A [recaptcha.net](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) account is required.

#### GnuPG email signing
Add these two options to your bridgedb.conf:

     EMAIL_GPG_SIGNING_ENABLED
     EMAIL_GPG_SIGNING_KEY
    
The former may be either True or False, and the latter must point to the
ascii-armored private key file. The keyfile must not be passphrase protected.

#### Preventing already-blocked bridges from being distributed
Uncomment or add ```COUNTRY_BLOCK_FILE``` to your bridgedb.conf. This file
should contain one bridge entry per line, in the format:
 
    fingerprint <bridge fingerprint> country-code <country code>

If the ```COUNTRY_BLOCK_FILE``` file is present, bridgedb will filter blocked
bridges from the responses it gives to clients requesting bridges.

#### Updating the SQL schema
Make sure that SQLite3 is installed. (You should have installed it already
during the setup and installation stage.) To update, do:

    sqlite3 path/to/bridgedist.db.sqlite

Enter the following commands at the ```sqlite>``` prompt: 

    CREATE TABLE BlockedBridges ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, hex_key, blocking_country);
    CREATE INDEX BlockedBridgesBlockingCountry on BlockedBridges(hex_key);
    CREATE TABLE WarnedEmails ( email PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, when_warned);
    CREATE INDEX WarnedEmailsWasWarned on WarnedEmails ( email );
    REPLACE INTO Config VALUES ( 'schema-version', 2 );
 

## Running BridgeDB

To run BridgeDB, simply make any necessary changes to bridgedb.conf, and
do: ```bridgedb```.

When you have new lists of bridges, replace the old files and do:

    bridgedb --reload

Make sure that the files and directories referred to in bridgedb.conf
exist. However, many of them, if not found, will be touched on disk so that
attempts to read/write from/to them will not raise excessive errors.

#### To extract bucket files of all unallocated bridges:
Edit the configuration file value ```FILE_BUCKETS``` according to your
needs. For example, the following is a possible configuration:

    FILE_BUCKETS = { "name1": 10, "name2": 15, "foobar": 3 }

This configuration for buckets would result in 3 files being created for
bridge distribution: name1-2010-07-17.brdgs, name2-2010-07-17.brdgs and
foobar-2010-07-17.brdgs. The first file would contain 10 bridges from
BridgeDB's 'unallocated' pool. The second file would contain 15 bridges from
the same pool and the third one similarly 3 bridges. These files can then be
handed out to trusted parties via mail or fed to other distribution mechanisms
such as Twitter.

#### To use with HTTPS:
Just connect to the appropriate port.

#### To use with email:
Any mail sent to the email port with a subject or a single line _exactly_
equal to "get bridges" will get answered, assuming the domain is okay.
