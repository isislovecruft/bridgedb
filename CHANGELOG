Changes in version 0.3.6 - 2016-07-28

        * FIXES #18237 https://bugs.torproject.org/18237
        During descriptor parsing, BridgeDB saves copies of descriptor files
        which couldn't be parsed, for later debugging purposes.  To avoid
        filing up the runtime directory with these files, we now delete files
        older than 24 hours, every 24 hours.

        * FIXES #18949 https://bugs.torproject.org/18949
        Since we've upgraded the host machine which runs The Tor Project's
        BridgeDB instance to Debian Jessie, this patch updates the testing
        configurations and continuous integration infrastructure to run
        tests on versions of Python dependencies in Debian Jessie and Stretch.


Changes in version 0.3.4 - 0.3.5 - 2015-11-30

        * FIXES #14685 https://bugs.torproject.org/14685
        This disables distribution of obfs2 bridges.  This pluggable
        transport has known distiguishers which allow adversaries to
        identify client connections to obfs2 bridges, which in turn allows
        these connections to be blocked/censored.  With numerous obfs3 and
        obfs4 bridges both readily available, users should not be
        presented with an easily-configurable choice that is known to be
        unsafe for the majority of users.

And includes the following general changes:

        * ADDS error pages to BridgeDB's web interface, to provide
        friendlier explanations for downtime, missing pages, and internal
        server errors.  For example: https://bridges.torproject.org/404


Changes in version 0.3.3 - 2015-10-25

        * FIXES #12029 https://bugs.torproject.org/12029
        BridgeDB now has an API for creating Bridge Distributors.
        See the bridgedb.distribute module, or its developer documentation
        at https://pythonhosted.org/bridgedb/bridgedb.distribute.html.

        * FIXES PART OF #12506  https://bugs.torproject.org/12506
        BridgeDB's two Distributors (HTTPS and Email) are now entirely
        modularised and self-contained within separate subdirectories in
        the source code.  This is the first step to redesigning these
        Distributors into their own separate processes, which will allow
        the Distributors to remain functional while BridgeDB is reparsing
        bridge descriptors.

        * FIXES #15968 https://bugs.torproject.org/15968
        BridgeDB now sends a Content-Security-Policy header which
        explicitly allows Javascript, images, CSS, and fonts, from
        https://bridges.torproject.org.  All other types of content are
        forbidden, including:
          - embedding https://bridges.torproject.org within
            <iframe>, <embed>, or <object>, and attempting to source
            additional resources into its embedded context
          - inline Javascript, including Javascript within SVG files
          - inline CSS
          - externally hosted fonts
          - inline SVG, e.g. via the HTML5 <svg> tag
          - any and all connections made via Javascript XMLHttpRequests,
            WebSockets, sendBeacon(), and Web Workers
          - plugins
          - applets
        BridgeDB's Content-Security-Policy does not yet make use of
        certain newer, lesser supported, Content-Security-Policy v2.0
        directives, such as "reflected-xss" and "frame-ancestors", but may
        someday.

        * FIXES #16273 https://bugs.torproject.org/16273
        Several links to Tor Project gitweb URLs within the developer
        documentation were outdated in that they still used the old gitweb
        URL format.  These are now updated.
        Thanks to David Fifield for the bug report and patches.

        * FIXES #16330 https://bugs.torproject.org/16330
        BridgeDB can now handle bridge-server-descriptors with
        extra-info-digest fields which have two values, as well as both
        bridge-server-descriptors and bridge-extrainfo descriptors which
        contain Ed25519 key material and signatures.  See Tor proposals
        #220 and #228 for more information on the changes to these
        descriptors.  Note that BridgeDB can now parse this information,
        but does not yet make use of any Ed25519 cryptographic material
        within bridge descriptors.

        https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/228-cross-certification-onionkeys.txt
        Thanks to Atagar for patching Stem.

        * FIXES #16616 https://bugs.torproject.org/16616
        The HSDir flag can now be included within bridge-networkstatus
        documents.  BridgeDB now has unittests which guarantee that its
        parsers safely ignore this flag, as well as any flags unknown to
        BridgeDB which may appear in the future.
        Thanks to Roger Dingledine for alerting me about the change.

        * FIXES #16649 https://bugs.torproject.org/16649
        Mobile users, and other users with small screen pixel ratios, will
        find that the UI of BridgeDB's HTTPS Distributor has greatly
        increased in usability and readability.


And includes the following general changes:

        * FIXES an error when requesting the non-HTML version of the
        bridges page (e.g. https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?format=plain)

        * REMOVES the `bridgedb test` commandline option.
        BridgeDB's tests can be run via `python setup.py test` or `make
        test` (or `make coverage` for generating HTML test coverage
        statistics).

        * CHANGES the HTTPS Distributor to HTML-encode Bridge Lines.
        Previously, a malicious Pluggable Transport Bridge could include
        in its PT arguments something like "evil=<script>[…]</script>" and
        if such a Bridge were to be distributed to a user, that user's web
        browser would execute the script (if Javacript was enabled).
        Other characters, including non-ASCII, control characters, double
        quotes, and backslashes, are also sanitised from Bridge Lines.
        Thanks to Robert Ransom for the patches.

        * CHANGES BridgeDB's module/package version numbers to be
        compliant with PEP440.

        * CHANGES the layout of BridgeDB's source code directories.
        Rather than storing BridgeDB's source in "lib/bridgedb/", it is
        now kept in "bridgedb/".  Similarly, the directory containing
        BridgeDB's tests has been moved from "lib/bridgedb/test/" to
        "test/", which means that the tests are no longer installed when
        running `python setup.py install` or `make install`.

        * ADDS several improvements to the developer documentation at
        https://pythonhosted.org/bridgedb.

          Thanks to x4r.


Changes in version 0.3.2 - 2015-05-01

        * FIXES a problem with the calculation of Levenshtein distances
        between blacklisted email addresses and those on incoming
        email. This fixes a problem with the fuzzy matching implemented in
        #9385: https://bugs.torproject.org/9385.

        * FIXES #1839 https://bugs.torproject.org/1839
        BridgeDB's distributors now rotate their hashrings at
        configurable scheduled intervals.

        * FIXES #4771 https://bugs.torproject.org/4771
        BridgeDB now records which of the HTTPS Distributor's
        sub-hashrings are used for clients coming from Tor Exit nodes and
        other known proxies.

        * FIXES #12504 https://bugs.torproject.org/12504
        Which Pluggable Transports BridgeDB distributes is now easily
        configurable via the bridgedb.conf configuration file.

        * FIXES #13202 https://bugs.torproject.org/13202
        Old bridges running Tor-0.2.4.x with Pluggable Transports like
        scramblesuit and obfs4proxy have a bug which causes them to not
        include the PT arguments in the `transport` line they submit to
        the BridgeAuthority in their extrainfo descriptors.  This causes
        BridgeDB to have broken bridge lines for these bridges.
                For example, scramblesuit requires a `password=` in the
        `ClientTransportPlugin` for clients to connect to it.  If BridgeDB
        receives a line in that bridge's extrainfo which says
        `transport scramblesuit 1.2.3.4:1234` (without a password), then
        when BridgeDB gives clients a bridge line for that bridge, it'll
        look like "Bridge scramblesuit 1.2.3.4:1234" - meaning that it won't
        work.  This fixes the issue by excluding broken transports from
        being distributed to clients.

        * FIXES #15517 https://bugs.torproject.org/15517
        For all clients who are coming from IPv6 addresses and are not
        using Tor, who go to https://bridges.torproject.org, BridgeDB now
        groups these clients together by /32.  This "grouping" causes all
        IPv6 clients within the same IPv6 /32 to get the same bridges.
        Previously, BridgeDB grouped IPv6 clients by /64 (which is
        ridiculously small, considering standard IPv6 allocation sizes).

        For all clients who are coming from IPv4 addresses and are not
        using Tor, BridgeDB now groups these clients together by /16.
        Previously, BridgeDB grouped IPv4 clients by /24.  (This latter
        change was technically made as part of #4771.)

        * FIXES #15464 https://bugs.torproject.org/15464
        The setup procedure for creating a BridgeDB Continuous Integration
        build machine is now simplified and generalised to include build
        environments like Jenkins, not just TravisCI.

        * FIXES #15866 https://bugs.torproject.org/15866
        BridgeDB now ignores nearly all the information in the
        networkstatus-bridges file created by the BridgeAuthority.

        * ADDS benchmark tests to BridgeDB's test suite, and some of
        BridgeDB's algorithms have been revised to improve their speed.


Changes in version 0.3.1 - 2015-03-24

        * FIXES #14065 https://bugs.torproject.org/14065
        When requesting vanilla IPv6 bridges from
        https://bridges.torproject.org, BridgeDB would respond with IPv4
        addresses.  It now correctly responds with IPv6 addresses.

And includes the following general changes:

        * FIXES an issue with the filtering of hashrings while answering
        requests for Pluggable Transports. (commit 3ef37df6)

        * FIXES the return value from the GnuPG interface initialization
        function (bridgedb.crypto.initializeGnuPG) when creating a test
        signature has failed.

        * CHANGES the way BridgeDB handles the case where it parses to
        duplicate extrainfo descriptors (for the same Bridge) which also
        have identical timestamps.  Before, we assumed this wasn't
        possible.  It turns out that it not only is possible, but that
        usually every batch of descriptors has at least one Bridge with
        such a set of perfectly identical extrainfo descriptors.  Even
        stranger, it appears that only Bridges started for the first time
        quite recently (within the last eight hours) display this
        behaviour.  BridgeDB now logs these errors, rather than leaving
        them unhandled.
        (commit a27d7905)

        * ADDS an environment variable check to setup.py which controls
        whether the setup.py script tries to install the dependencies
        listed in the requirements.txt file with easy_install.  If the
        environment variable BRIDGEDB_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES=0, then
        setup.py will not use easy_install.  When BridgeDB is installed
        via `make install` the default is to not use easy_install;
        however, when installed via `python setup.py install`, the default
        is to use easy_install to check for, find, and install
        dependencies.  (NOTE: the latter is *not* recommended.)
        (commit d035fe64)


Changes in version 0.3.0 - 2015-03-21

        * FIXES #2895 https://bugs.torproject.org/2895
        BridgeDB no longer assumes that any extrainfo descriptor files are
        in chronological order.

        * FIXES #4405 https://bugs.torproject.org/4405
        BridgeDB now has a built-in timer mechanism for scheduling
        cronjobesque events. This is now used to routinely download and
        parse the list of Tor exit relays in a completely asynchronous
        manner.

        * FIXES #9380 https://bugs.torproject.org/9380
        BridgeDB now uses Stem (https://stem.torproject.org) for its
        parsers, and has better classes for parsing and storing
        information on Bridges and their Pluggable Transports.
        Additionally, all of BridgeDB's parses and the new
        Bridge/PluggableTransport classes all have 100% unittest and
        integration test coverage.

        * FIXES #10385 https://bugs.torproject.org/10385
        BridgeDB now uses python-gnupg (https://pypi.python.org/gnupg)
        instead of GPGME (libgpgme11 and pygpgme). Previously, when using
        GPGME, BridgeDB was unable to sign emails with a subkey whose
        master private key was not present, causing all signing to be
        broken. Additionally, GPGME tried to access and modify the
        BridgeDB users $HOME directory, and GPGME would also try to create
        signatures with encryption-only subkeys, and try to
        encrypt/decrypt with signing-only subkeys. All of these issues are
        no more, because the writhing tangled mass of bugs known ad GPGME
        is gone for good.

        * FIXES #11216 https://bugs.torproject.org/11216
        BridgeDB no longer parses any extrainfo descriptor files
        cumulatively. Before, a Bridge which had a descriptor in
        cached-extrainfo and in cached-extrainfo.new and supported obfs3,
        obfs4, and scramblesuit transports would be parsed twice,
        resulting in the Bridge having six transports. This is no longer
        the case.

        * HOTFIXES an issue with non-deterministic unittest failures in
        the Mechanize-based integrations tests in
        lib/bridgedb/test/test_https.py. hotfix/0.2.4-mechanize-tags

        * FIXES part of #12507 https://bugs.torproject.org/12507
        BridgeDB now has semi-automated developer documentation builds at
        https://pythonhosted.org/bridgedb/.

        * FIXES #12805 https://bugs.torproject.org/12805
        BridgeDB is now packaged on PyPI, in the hopes that someday other
        organisations will be able to run their own BridgeDBs.

        * FIXES #12843 https://bugs.torproject.org/12843
        BridgeDB will no longer distribute bridges which it believes are
        located in Iran or Syria.

        * FIXES #12872 https://bugs.torproject.org/12872
        BridgeDB now has geolocational information for Bridges, telling it
        which country each Bridge's primary ORAddress is within, as well
        as geolocational information for each PluggableTransport address.
        Thanks to Alden S. Page for the patches.

        * FIXES #15155 https://bugs.torproject.org/15155
        The instructions for obtaining a copy of Tor Browser should now be
        more clear.
        Thanks to Jens Kubieziel, Nick Mathewson, and Peter Palfrader.

And includes the following general changes:
        * CHANGES BridgeDB's continuous integration infrastructure to run
        tests for:
                - Twisted-13.2.0 (Debian Wheezy version),
                - Twisted-14.0.2 (Debian Jessie version), and
                - Twisted-15.0.0 (latest and greatest)
        As well as testing both:
                - pyOpenSSL-0.13.1 (Debian Wheezy version), and
                - pyOpenSSL-0.14 (Debian Jessie version).
        See https://travis-ci.org/isislovecruft/bridgedb/builds

        * FIXES an issue with the $PYTHON_EGG_CACHE directory being group
        writable on Travis-CI build machines.

        * UPDATE English (en_US) translations.

        * UPDATE English (en) translations.

Changes in version 0.2.4 - 2015-02-03

        * HOTFIXES a UnicodeDecodeError resulting from patches for #12627.
        https://bugs.torproject.org/12627

        * FIXES #9874 https://bugs.torproject.org/9874
        BridgeDB now has integration tests for all bridge distributors.
        Thanks to trygve for the patches.

        * FIXES #12871 https://bugs.torproject.org/12871
        Bridge Buckets now work, even if the code for calculating Bridge
        stability is disabled.
        Thanks to Matt Finkel for the patches.

        * FIXES part of #12029 https://bugs.torproject.org/12029
        Major sections of the bridgedb.Bridges module, which holds
        BridgeDB's main data structures for storing and parsing Bridges,
        have been refactored in preparation for upcoming changes to use
        Stem's parsers (see #9380 https://bugs.torproject.org/9380)

        * FIXES #12932 https://bugs.torproject.org/12932
        Arguments for Pluggable Transports in the bridge lines which
        BridgeDB distributes to users are now properly
        space-separated. This issue was affecting the deployment of the
        obfs4 PT (see #12130 https://bugs.torproject.org/12130).

        * FIXES #13123 https://bugs.torproject.org/13123
        Previously, there were two additional whitespace characters at the
        beginning of bridge lines handed out by BridgeDB's HTTPS
        distributor, which would be annoyingly copy+pasted into TorLauncher
        and torrcs, etc.  These are now gone.

        * FIXES #12664 https://bugs.torproject.org/12664
        Previously, for the bridge lines handed out by BridgeDB's HTTPS
        distributor, the newlines were not properly pasted when a user
        would copy+paste the lines. This is now fixed. Additionally, there
        is now a "Select All" button (JS must be enabled) to select all
        text for the bridge lines, to attempt to reduce user copy+paste
        errors.  If the display area which contains the bridge lines is
        clicked, and JS is enabled, it has the same effect as clicking the
        "Select All" button.

        * FIXES #14064 https://bugs.torproject.org/14064
        The bridge lines handed out by BridgeDB's HTTPS distributor are
        now displayed with a horizontal scrollbar if they are too long to
        fit into the display area.

        * FIXES #11345 https://bugs.torproject.org/11345
        BridgeDB now supports giving users QRCodes for their bridge lines,
        to facilitate getting bridges into Tails and onto mobile devices.

        * FIXES #12130 https://bugs.torproject.org/12130
        BridgeDB's distributors now have options to distribute obfs4 bridges.

And includes the following general changes:
        * CHANGES the integration tests based on Mechanize to only run on
        CI servers, not locally on developers laptops, since it requires
        the running BridgeDB test/staging instance to offer a plaintext
        HTTP interface. See commit 24acf6a72.
        https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/commit/?id=24acf6a72931c602631c97dbbeb582c22cf446cb

        * ADDS better installation instructions in README.rst for
        developers who wish to test their changes to BridgeDB.
        Thanks to Alden Page for the patch.


Changes in version 0.2.3 - 2014-07-26

        * FIXES #5463 https://bugs.torproject.org/5463
        BridgeDB can now OpenPGP sign outgoing emails.

        * FIXES #9385 https://bugs.torproject.org/9385
        BridgeDB now has the ability to blacklist email addresses, and
        configurable options to fuzzy match and block addresses which are
        similar enough to those in the blacklist.

        * FIXES #11139 https://bugs.torproject.org/11139
        You can now email BridgeDB from Riseup email addresses!

        * FIXES #12147 https://bugs.torproject.org/12147
        An additional issue with BridgeDB's code for scheduling actions
        was identified by Robert Ransom, who also provided a unittest to
        demonstrate the issue and test for future regressions. The issue
        pointed out has also been fixed.

        * FIXES #12635 https://bugs.torproject.org/12635
        The links in BridgeDB's email and HTTPS distributor UIs have been
        changed from the obsolete
        https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-beta
        to https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.

        * FIXES #12650 https://bugs.torproject.org/12650
        BridgeDB's translation files sometimes take a little while to
        update because real live human volunteers need to go to
        Transifex.org and convert the strings between languages. Then I
        need to import the strings, check all of them by hand to make sure
        there's no funny business which could harm users in them, and then
        commit all the diffs. Sadly, there isn't much more we can do to
        speed up this process, so sometimes BridgeDB's UI falls back to
        English when it doesn't have new enough translations files. Sorry!

And includes the following general changes:

        * UPDATE translation: Chinese - Taiwan (zh_TW)
                THANKS TO danfong.

Changes in version 0.2.2 - 2014-06-06

        * FIXES #9874 https://bugs.torproject.org/9874
        BridgeDB's email and HTTPS distributors were written in a manner
        that makes them largely impossible to write unittests for. Since
        the recent rewrite of BridgeDB's email distributor server backends
        for version 0.2.1, BridgeDB email distributor is now testable and
        has near 100% code coverage, see
        https://coveralls.io/r/isislovecruft/bridgedb

        * FIXES #12086 https://bugs.torproject.org/12086
        BridgeDB was found to accept incoming emails sent to any email
        address whose local part included the word bridges, e.g. emails
        sent to 'givemebridges@serious.ly' would be responded to as if
        they were destined for BridgeDB's real email address.
          - BridgeDB now strictly checks that the local part of the email
            address that an incoming email was sent to (after removing plus
            aliases, i.e. '+es_ES', '+fa', etc.) exactly matches BridgeDB
            configured email address username.
          - BridgeDB now checks that the domain name portion of the email
            address that an incoming email was sent to either matches the
            domain name portion of BridgeDB's configured email address, or
            is a subdomain of that domain.

        * FIXES #12089 https://bugs.torproject.org/12089
        There has been a bug for quite some time now where BridgeDB could
        be used to email arbitrary email addresses (as long as these
        addresses were ones which BridgeDB allows, i.e. Gmail or Yahoo
        email addresses). This was due to BridgeDB not checking that the
        email address used in the SMTP 'MAIL FROM:' command on an incoming
        message matched the one used in that email's 'From:'
        header.
          - BridgeDB now checks that the email addresses in the SMTP 'MAIL
            FROM:' and the 'From:' header on that incoming email match, in
            addition to the previous checks that the email address' domain
            is in the set of allowed domains.

        * FIXES #12090 https://bugs.torproject.org/12090
        BridgeDB has been replying with an empty email. I don't actually
        know for sure if this one is fixed. Before deploying version
        0.2.1, the continuous integration tests showed email responses
        being correctly generated, and I was also able to receive
        correctly formed email responses from BridgeDB on a local testing
        instance on my laptop. It appears that this bug occurs only on the
        deployment server at ponticum.torproject.org, possibly due to the
        outdated Python version in Debian Wheezy. I have not been able to
        reproduce this bug on any other machine.

        * FIXES #12091 https://bugs.torproject.org/12091
        BridgeDB wasn't properly ignoring emails whose DKIM signature
        verification header read "X-DKIM-Authentication-Results: dunno".
          - Bridgedb now marks incoming emails which have a
            "X-DKIM-Authentication-Results: dunno" header as invalid and
            ignores them.

        * FIXES #12147 https://bugs.torproject.org/12147
        If a user refreshed https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges after
        successfully solving a CAPTCHA, BridgeDB would reply with a new
        set of bridges for each page refresh. This was due to the use of
        `getInterval()` in `IPBasedDistributor.getBridgesForIP()`.  The
        correct function to use is `getIntervalStart()`.  This had been
        noted in a "XXX FIXME" comment above the call for quite some time,
        however, when the `bridgedb.schedule` (previously called
        `bridgedb.Time`) module was revised to support CAPTCHA timeouts
        (#11215), the call to `getInterval()` was mistakenly not replaced
        with the correct function.
          - BridgeDB CAPTCHAs must be solved within 10 minutes.
          - Hashring rotation for bridges in BridgeDB HTTPS distributor
            occurs every 3 hours. Refreshing the page with bridges on it
            will return these same bridges for that time period, and
            afterwards redirect back to the CAPTCHA page.
        THANKS TO francisco on IRC and arma for reporting the bug.

        * FIXES #12212 https://bugs.torproject.org/12122
        TRANSLATOR comments are now properly extracted into the gettext PO
        template file.

And include the following general changes:
        * FIXES an issue where, when verifying GnuPG signatures made by
        BridgeDB's email distributor, GnuPG would error, saying, "invalid
        armor header".

        * ADD Korean (ko) translations.
          Thanks to ilbe123, cwt96, Dr.what, and pCsOrI.

        * UPDATE Ukranian (uk) translations.
          Thanks to LinuxChata and ghostishev.

        * UPDATE Turkish (tr) translations.
          Thanks to volkangezer.

        * UPDATE Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR) translations.
          Thanks to Communia, Humberto Sartini, Anastasia01, and recognitium.

        * UPDATE Polish (pl) translations.
          Thanks to hoek, yodaa, maxxx, and sebx.

        * UPDATE Dutch (nl) translations.
          Thanks to Ann Boen, erwindelaat, guryman, and BBLN.
          You guys are extra awesome for translating the phrase:
              "Uh oh, spaghettios!"
          into the Dutch:
              "Helaas pindakaas!"
          which, in English, literally means:
              "Unfortunately, peanut butter!"
          You guys totally just made my day. Thanks.

        * UPDATE Japanese (ja) translations.
          Thanks to plazmism, who is extra awesome for translating the phrase:
              "Uh oh, spaghettios!"
          into the Japanese:
              "おっとスパゲッティ！"
          which apparently the literal English translation is:
              "Husband spaghetti!"

        * UPDATE Italian (it) translations.
          Thanks to Random_R.

        * UPDATE Canadian French (fr_CA) translations.
          Thanks to Lunar.

        * UPDATE Spanish (es) translations.
          Thanks to dark_yoshi and strel.

        * UPDATE Greek (el) translations.
          Thanks to pappasadrian.

        * UPDATE German (de) translations.
          Thanks to trantor and unknwon_anonymous.

        * UPDATE Danish (da) translations.
          Thanks to autofunk78 and DavidNielsen.


Changes in version 0.2.1 - 2014-05-16
        * FIXES #5463 https://bugs.torproject.org/5463
        Emails sent from BridgeDB's email distributor should now be signed.
          - BridgeDB's emails will be signed with its online GnuPG keypair. The
            public key has the following fingerprint:
                DF81 1109 E17C 8BF1 34B5  EEB6 8DC4 3A28 4882 1E32
            The online keypair rotates (a new one is placed on the server once
            per year), and it will ALWAYS be signed with BridgeDB's offline
            keypair.
          - The online keypair above contains two subkeys. The signing subkey
            has the fingerprint:
                9FE3 9D1A 7438 9223 3B3F  66F2 21B5 54E9 5938 F4D0
          - BridgeDB's offline keypair has the following fingerprint:
                7B78 4370 15E6 3DF4 7BB1  270A CBD9 7AA2 4E8E 472E
        All of BridgeDB's keys may be found on the public keyservers, as
        well as at https://bridges.torproject.org/keys

        * FIXES #7547 https://bugs.torproject.org/7547
        BridgeDB's email distributor will now send you a message
        explaining how to use it, including valid commands and the list of
        Pluggable Transport TYPES currently supported. To receive help
        with the email distributor, simply send an email to
        mailto:bridges@torproject.org.
          - Any emails which do not contain a valid command will receive
        the help text in response.
          - Otherwise, to specifically request the help text, just say
                "get help"
        in the body of your email.

        * FIXES #7550 https://bugs.torproject.org/7550
        BridgeDB's email responder is now interactive, as described in the
        above entry for ticket #7547.

        * FIXES #8241 https://bugs.torproject.org/8241
        BridgeDB's HTTP distributor won't tell you how to get obfs3
        bridges through email, although a blank email, or an email
        containing "get help" will.

        * CLOSES #9678 https://bugs.torproject.org/9678
        A "Select Language" button was requested for the HTTP distributor
        on https://bridges.torproject.org. Instead, translated pages are
        distributed automatically (via detecting the "Accept-Language"
        header which can be set in the Settings panel of all modern
        browers).
          - To request a specific translation, the "lang=LOCALE" argument
        can be added to the URL of any page. For example:
        https://bridges.torproject.org/options?lang=ar
        will provide the bridge options selection page in Arabic.

        * FIXES #11215 https://bugs.torproject.org/11215
        BridgeDB's usage of gimp-captcha, which creates a local cache of
        CAPTCHA for use on the HTTP distributor, now supports timeouts. If
        a CAPTCHA is not solved within 30 minutes of being served to a
        client, the solution is invalid regardless of its correctness.

        * FIXES #11475 https://bugs.torproject.org/11475
        BridgeDB's email responder, up until this point, explained how to
        use bridges with Vidalia. It now uses the same help text as found
        at https://bridges.torproject.org/howto which explains how to
        enter bridges into TorLauncher (used by Tor Browser and Tails).

        * FIXES #11522 https://bugs.torproject.org/11522
        There were several errors and bugs in BridgeDB's email
        distributor. The entire system of server supporting BridgeDB's
        email distribution system was rewritten.

        * FIXES #11664 https://bugs.torproject.org/11664
        Due to changes in the Python language builtin `buffer` in Python3,
        which were backported to Python 2.7.6, but neither backported to
        Python 2.6.x nor to Python <= 2.7.5, BridgeDB's use of
        `io.StringIO` and `io.BytesIO` combined with buffers had to be
        revised to support both the new and old Python `buffer` APIs.

        * FIXES #11753 https://bugs.torproject.org/11753
        BridgeDB's emails should now be translated.
          - The translations system for BridgeDB, as well as the template
        system for emails, was completely rewritten.  By default, email
        responses are in English. To receive an alternate translation,
        send an email to bridges+LOCALE@torproject.org, where "LOCALE" is
        a locale specifier.
          - For example, to receive BridgeDB emails translated into
        Chinese, use mailto:bridges+zh_CN@torproject.org.
          - Or for Farsi translations, use mailto:bridges+fa@torproject.org.
          - For the full list of currently supported LOCALE codes, see
        https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/isis/bridgedb.git/tree/HEAD:/lib/bridgedb/i18n/

And includes the following general changes:
        * UPDATES the Italian (it) gettext file.
          Thanks to Francesca Ciceri.
        * ADD Welsh (cy) translations.
          Thanks to huwwaters and littlegreykida.
        * ADD Slovak (sk) translations.
          Thanks to Michelozzo and Svistwarrior273.
        * UPDATES the bridgedb.pot translation template file. All the new
        strings in the email and HTTP user interfaces will now need
        translation! To help out with translations, please see:
        https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/2-bridgedb-bridgedb-pot/
        * FIXES several typos in the BridgeDB's code documentation.
        * ADDS code documentation for several previously undocumented modules.

Changes in version 0.2.0 - 2014-04-19
        * FIXES #5232 Perform long running and blocking transactions in
                background threads. Primarily this moves bridge descriptor
                reparsing into another thread, which significantly increases
                the availability of BridgeDB.
        * FIXES #9119 BridgeDB's logger now automatically sanitises all email
                and IP addresses when the SAFELOGGING config option is enabled.
        * FIXES #9875 BridgeDB logger now has 100% unittest coverage.
        * FIXES #10803 Vidalia is no longer mentioned on
                https://bridges.torproject.org, and instead there are new
                instructions on how to enter bridges into TBB>=3.5 (with
                TorLauncher).
        * FIXES #11346 The web interface now has a homepage link. By clicking
                "BridgeDB" in the upper left corner, users can go back to the
                start of TBB downloading and bridge selection instructions at
                https://bridges.torproject.org.
        * FIXES #11370 We were using an old (and deprecated) module when we
                created our email responses. Now we use the newer version.
        * FIXES #11377 CAPTCHAs on BridgeDB's HTTPS interface are now
                case-insensitive.
                Thanks to Kostas Jakeliunas for the patch.
        * FIXES #11522 fixes several issues with encodings and exception
                handling in the email distributor.

And includes the following general changes:
        * NEW interface design for https://bridges.torproject.org, including
                updated CSS stylesheets, fonts, and HTML templates. In
                particular, the https://bridges.torproject.org/options page has
                been redesigned completely.
                Thanks to Xengi for providing a modified design of the "roots"
                Tor Project logo, which is used to link to
                https://www.torproject.org.
        * CHANGES the TBB download link on the main web interface page to link
                to the new TBB-3.6.x-beta bundles, which include patches by
                David Fifield to unify TBB and PTTBB into one browser, so that
                Pluggable Transports (PTs) are only enabled when the user
                includes a bridge line which uses that PT.
        * FIXES plaintext responses on https://bridges.torproject.org,
                these can be requested by using the 'format' HTTP parameter,
                like so: https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?format=plain
        * FIXES the logging of all lines of (including headers!) of incoming
                emails.
        * FIXES logfile rotation so that the files are only reable/writable
                by the running process owner, and no other user.
        * CHANGES the data format used for encrypted-then-HMACed CAPTCHAs
                to assume that the HMAC is the first 20 bytes. Before we
                assumed that the HMAC was separated from the encrypted data
                with a ';' character, which causes intermittent issues with
                some encoding and CAPTCHA solution values.
        * REFACTORS some of the translations handling code, so that soon emails
                will be translated (see #7550), and
                https://bridges.torproject.org should have a "Select Language"
                button (see #9678).
        * BUMPS leekspin version to 0.1.3.

Changes in version 0.1.6 - 2014-03-26
BridgeDB 0.1.6 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #11196 BridgeDB should use leekspin
        * FIXES #11218 ReCaptchaProtectedResource.checkSolution()
                doesn't expect a deferred
        * FIXES #11219 BridgeDB's twisted version doesn´t have a
                `t.w.client.HTTPConnectionPool` class
        * FIXES #11231 BridgeDB's txrecaptcha returns the "No bridges
                available!" page if 'captcha_response_field' is blank

And includes the following general changes:
        * ADDS several new translations languages.

Changes in version 0.1.5 - 2014-02-27
BridgeDB 0.1.5 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's bridge
                pool assignment files
        * FIXES #10809 reCAPTCHA on bridges.torproject.org are impossible
                to solve for humans
        * FIXES #10834 Configurable reCAPTCHA remoteip
        * FIXES #11127 reCaptcha verification is hardcoded to use
                plaintext HTTP

And includes the following general changes:
        * CHANGES the way the client's IP address is reported to the
        reCaptcha API server. Previously, for each client request, a
        completely random IP address was generated, and BridgeDB lied to
        the reCaptcha server by sending this random IP and saying that it
        was the client's IP. With these changes, BridgeDB can be
        configured to report a static IP address (it's own IP) as the
        client's IP, in the hopes that the IP whitelisting used by
        reCaptcha makes the returned CAPTCHAs less impossible to solve.
        * ADDS the ability to use a local cache of CAPTCHAs created by
        scripting Gimp with Python. See:
        https://github.com/isislovecruft/gimp-captcha
        * USES TLS during CAPTCHA solution verification when using
        reCaptcha.


Changes in version 0.1.4 - 2014-02-21
BridgeDB 0.1.4 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES an RTL encoding issue in the "Step 2" text on index.html
                of the HTTPS distributor.


Changes in version 0.1.3 - 2014-02-21
BridgeDB 0.1.3 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's bridge
                pool assignment files
        * FIXES a bug caused by attempts to convert descriptor digests
                which could not be parsed into hexadecimal.
        * FIXES a unicode decoding error within the bridgedb.persistent
                module.
        * REMOVES continuous integration testing for Python 2.6.

Including the following general changes:
        * ADD volunteer page text for GSoC 2014 applications.


Changes in version 0.1.2 - 2014-02-05
BridgeDB 0.1.2 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #10811 BridgeDB's assignments.log files are not being updated


Changes in version 0.1.1 - 2014-02-03
BridgeDB 0.1.1 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9127 Users can't ask for ipv6 bridges with the new bridgedb
                interface
        * FIXES #9988 Refactor BridgeDB's use of `sha` module to use `hashlib`
        * FIXES #10724 Most of the time spent in testing, as well as most
                of the time spent when "BridgeDB is down" (i.e. when I reply
                with "BridgeDB is single-threaded (see #5232) and is parsing
                millions of descriptors"), is within the same
                `bridgedb.Stability.addOrUpdateBridgeHistory()` function (see
                #10724). This function is pretty brutal on CPU and memory, is
                blocking, and it needs to runs thousands and thousands of
                times whenever BridgeDB is restarted (every half hour). The
                algorithm within that function has a time complexity increasing
                linearithmically relative to the number of bridges and timestamps
                already within the database. [0]
                This patch adds a config option to disable/enable running
                the `addOrUpdateBridgeHistory()` function.
                [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linearithmic_time
        * FIXES #10737 POST arguments to bridges.torproject.org are dropped if
                entering a CAPTCHA fails

Including the following general changes:
        * ADDS A general simple error page to display rather than
                webserver tracebacks. See #6127.
        * MOVES The recently added BridgeDB specification file
                ('doc/bridge-db-spec.txt') to the torspec repo:
                https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git
        * FIXES template caching for the web interface.


Changes in version 0.1.0 - 2014-01-14
BridgeDB 0.1.0 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #1606 Write a BridgeDB spec
        * FIXES #3573 bridges.torproject.org doesn't have a robots.txt
        * FIXES #6127 bridges.tpo runs in development mode
        * FIXES #9013 BridgeDB should pass pluggable transport
                shared-secrets to clients
        * FIXES #9157 Persian and Arabic should be right aligned on bridges.tpo
        * FIXES #9462 BridgeDB netstatus descriptor parsers need refactoring
        * FIXES #9959 BridgeDB seems to be missing English translations
        * FIXES #9865 Add automated code coverage report generation
        * FIXES #9872 Create a test runner for BridgeDB unittests
        * FIXES #9873 Convert BridgeDB's old unittests to use twisted.trial
        * FIXES #9937 Create fake non-sanitised bridge descriptors for
                BridgeDB testing purposes
        * FIXES #10333 Indexing list-like objects by 0L in
                Bridges.getConfigLine
        * FIXES #10446 BridgeDB is/was using a GeoIP module which is
                incompatible with virtualenvs
        * FIXES #10559 BridgeDB writes `keyid=` before fingerprints

Including the following general changes:
        * ADD Numerous unittests and automated continuous integration testing.
        * ADD Patches by sysrqb to correctly render right-to-left languages.
        * FIXES fallback languages for translations.
        * ADD Sphinx makefiles, substantial amounts of documentation.
        * ADD Documentations builds (currently at
              https://para.noid.cat/bridgedb)


Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2013-08-20
BridgeDB 0.0.1 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #5332 Update BridgeDB documentation with deployment
                instructions
        * FIXES #9156 BridgeDB: Users try to add obfsbridges to their
                normal TBB
        These commits were added to fix a compatibility issue with
        Vidalia, though they may be reverted to switch back to the old
        behaviour of returning bridge lines in the form:
          Bridge [transport_method] address:port [keyid=fingerprint] [K=v] […]
        in order to work with torrc files and the new TBB-3.x packages
        which use TorLauncher instead of Vidalia.
        * PARTIAL FIX #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's
                  bridge pool assignment files.
        * FIXES #9425 Create and document a better BridgeDB (re)deployment
                strategy

Including the following general changes:
        * UPDATE translations files with finished files from Transifex for
        the strings for the newly-refactored web interface created by
        gsathya.
        * ADD an automatic version-numbering system as part of developing
        a better deployment strategy.
        * CHANGE setup.py script to automatically install Python-based
        dependencies from requirements.txt.
        * REMOVE MANIFEST.in and put equivalent 'include' directives into
        setup.py (the less places we have for manually keeping track of
        files, the better).
        * REMOVE the "bridge " prefix from the lines returned on the web
        interface.
