Changes in version 0.1.7 -
        * FIXES #5232 Perform long running and blocking transactions
                in background threads. Primarily this moves bridge
                descriptor reparsing into another thread and
                significantly increased the availability of BridgeDB,
                as a result.
        * FIXES #11370 We were using an old (and deprecated) module when
                we created our email responses. Now we use the newer
                version. This should only affect internal functionality
                and should not result in any noticable user-visible changes.
        * FIXES #11377 CAPTCHAs on BridgeDB's HTTPS interface are now
                case-insensitive. Patch thanks to Kostas Jakeliunas.

And includes the following general changes:
        * BUMPS leekspin version to 0.1.3


Changes in version 0.1.6 - 2014-03-26
BridgeDB 0.1.6 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #11196 BridgeDB should use leekspin
        * FIXES #11218 ReCaptchaProtectedResource.checkSolution()
                doesn't expect a deferred
        * FIXES #11219 BridgeDB's twisted version doesn´t have a
                `t.w.client.HTTPConnectionPool` class
        * FIXES #11231 BridgeDB's txrecaptcha returns the "No bridges
                available!" page if 'captcha_response_field' is blank

And includes the following general changes:
        * ADDS several new translations languages.

Changes in version 0.1.5 - 2014-02-27
BridgeDB 0.1.5 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's bridge
                pool assignment files
        * FIXES #10809 reCAPTCHA on bridges.torproject.org are impossible
                to solve for humans
        * FIXES #10834 Configurable reCAPTCHA remoteip
        * FIXES #11127 reCaptcha verification is hardcoded to use
                plaintext HTTP

And includes the following general changes:
        * CHANGES the way the client's IP address is reported to the
        reCaptcha API server. Previously, for each client request, a
        completely random IP address was generated, and BridgeDB lied to
        the reCaptcha server by sending this random IP and saying that it
        was the client's IP. With these changes, BridgeDB can be
        configured to report a static IP address (it's own IP) as the
        client's IP, in the hopes that the IP whitelisting used by
        reCaptcha makes the returned CAPTCHAs less impossible to solve.
        * ADDS the ability to use a local cache of CAPTCHAs created by
        scripting Gimp with Python. See:
        https://github.com/isislovecruft/gimp-captcha
        * USES TLS during CAPTCHA solution verification when using
        reCaptcha.


Changes in version 0.1.4 - 2014-02-21
BridgeDB 0.1.4 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES an RTL encoding issue in the "Step 2" text on index.html
                of the HTTPS distributor.


Changes in version 0.1.3 - 2014-02-21
BridgeDB 0.1.3 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's bridge
                pool assignment files
        * FIXES a bug caused by attempts to convert descriptor digests
                which could not be parsed into hexadecimal.
        * FIXES a unicode decoding error within the bridgedb.persistent
                module.
        * REMOVES continuous integration testing for Python 2.6.

Including the following general changes:
        * ADD volunteer page text for GSoC 2014 applications.


Changes in version 0.1.2 - 2014-02-05
BridgeDB 0.1.2 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #10811 BridgeDB's assignments.log files are not being updated


Changes in version 0.1.1 - 2014-02-03
BridgeDB 0.1.1 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #9127 Users can't ask for ipv6 bridges with the new bridgedb
                interface
        * FIXES #9988 Refactor BridgeDB's use of `sha` module to use `hashlib`
        * FIXES #10724 Most of the time spent in testing, as well as most
                of the time spent when "BridgeDB is down" (i.e. when I reply
                with "BridgeDB is single-threaded (see #5232) and is parsing
                millions of descriptors"), is within the same
                `bridgedb.Stability.addOrUpdateBridgeHistory()` function (see
                #10724). This function is pretty brutal on CPU and memory, is
                blocking, and it needs to runs thousands and thousands of
                times whenever BridgeDB is restarted (every half hour). The
                algorithm within that function has a time complexity increasing
                linearithmically relative to the number of bridges and timestamps
                already within the database. [0]
                This patch adds a config option to disable/enable running
                the `addOrUpdateBridgeHistory()` function.

        * FIXES #10737 POST arguments to bridges.torproject.org are dropped if
                entering a CAPTCHA fails

Including the following general changes:
        * ADDS A general simple error page to display rather than
                webserver tracebacks. See #6127.
        * MOVES The recently added BridgeDB specification file
                ('doc/bridge-db-spec.txt') to the torspec repo:
                https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git
        * FIXES template caching for the web interface.

        * FIXES #1606 Write a BridgeDB spec
        * FIXES #3573 bridges.torproject.org doesn't have a robots.txt
        * FIXES #6127 bridges.tpo runs in development mode
        * FIXES #9013 BridgeDB should pass pluggable transport
                shared-secrets to clients
        * FIXES #9157 Persian and Arabic should be right aligned on bridges.tpo
        * FIXES #9462 BridgeDB netstatus descriptor parsers need refactoring
        * FIXES #9959 BridgeDB seems to be missing English translations
        * FIXES #9865 Add automated code coverage report generation
        * FIXES #9872 Create a test runner for BridgeDB unittests
        * FIXES #9873 Convert BridgeDB's old unittests to use twisted.trial
        * FIXES #9937 Create fake non-sanitised bridge descriptors for
                BridgeDB testing purposes
        * FIXES #10333 Indexing list-like objects by 0L in
                Bridges.getConfigLine
        * FIXES #10446 BridgeDB is/was using a GeoIP module which is
                incompatible with virtualenvs
        * FIXES #10559 BridgeDB writes `keyid=` before fingerprints

Including the following general changes:
        * ADD Numerous unittests and automated continuous integration testing.
        * ADD Patches by sysrqb to correctly render right-to-left languages.
        * FIXES fallback languages for translations.
        * ADD Sphinx makefiles, substantial amounts of documentation.
        * ADD Documentations builds (currently at
              https://para.noid.cat/bridgedb)


Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2013-08-20
BridgeDB 0.0.1 includes fixes for the following bugs:
        * FIXES #5332 Update BridgeDB documentation with deployment
                instructions
        * FIXES #9156 BridgeDB: Users try to add obfsbridges to their
                normal TBB
        These commits were added to fix a compatibility issue with
        Vidalia, though they may be reverted to switch back to the old
        behaviour of returning bridge lines in the form:
          Bridge [transport_method] address:port [keyid=fingerprint] [K=v] […]
        in order to work with torrc files and the new TBB-3.x packages
        which use TorLauncher instead of Vidalia.
        * PARTIAL FIX #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's
                  bridge pool assignment files.
        * FIXES #9425 Create and document a better BridgeDB (re)deployment
                strategy

Including the following general changes:
        * UPDATE translations files with finished files from Transifex for
        the strings for the newly-refactored web interface created by
        gsathya.
        * ADD an automatic version-numbering system as part of developing
        a better deployment strategy.
        * CHANGE setup.py script to automatically install Python-based
        dependencies from requirements.txt.
        * REMOVE MANIFEST.in and put equivalent 'include' directives into
        setup.py (the less places we have for manually keeping track of
        files, the better).
        * REMOVE the "bridge " prefix from the lines returned on the web
        interface.
