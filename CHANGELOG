Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2013-08-20
BridgeDB 0.0.1 includes fixes for the following bugs:
	* FIXES #5332 Update BridgeDB documentation with deployment
		instructions
	* FIXES #9156 BridgeDB: Users try to add obfsbridges to their
		normal TBB
	These commits were added to fix a compatibility issue with
	Vidalia, though they may be reverted to switch back to the old
	behaviour of returning bridge lines in the form:
	  Bridge [transport_method] address:port [keyid=fingerprint] [K=v] […]
	in order to work with torrc files and the new TBB-3.x packages
	which use TorLauncher instead of Vidalia.
	* PARTIAL FIX #9264 Problem with transport lines in BridgeDB's
	          bridge pool assignment files.

		strategy

	the strings for the newly-refactored web interface created by
	gsathya.
	* ADD an automatic version-numbering system as part of developing
	a better deployment strategy.
	* CHANGE setup.py script to automatically install Python-based
	dependencies from requirements.txt.
	* REMOVE MANIFEST.in and put equivalent 'include' directives into
	setup.py (the less places we have for manually keeping track of
	files, the better).
	* REMOVE the "bridge " prefix from the lines returned on the web
	interface.
