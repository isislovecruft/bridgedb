   | |_ extractEmailAddress() - Validate a :rfc:2822 email address.
   | |_ isIPAddress() - Check if an arbitrary string is an IP address.
   | |_ isIPv4() - Check if an arbitrary string is an IPv4 address.
   | |_ isIPv6() - Check if an arbitrary string is an IPv6 address.
   | \_ isValidIP() - Check that an IP address is valid.
   |
   |_ PortList - A container class for validated port ranges.

How address validity is determined
----------------------------------

The following terms define addresses which are **not** valid. All other
addresses are taken to be valid.


Private IP Address Ranges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. glossary::

   Private Address
     These address ranges are reserved by IANA for private intranets, and not
     routable to the Internet::
         10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  (10.0.0.0/8)
         172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  (172.16.0.0/12)
         192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
     For additional information, see :rfc:`1918`.


Reserved and Special Use Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. glossary::

   Unspecified Address
   Default Route
     Current network (only valid as source address). See :rfc:`1122`. An
     **Unspecified Address** in the context of firewalls means "all addresses
     of the local machine". In a routing context, it is usually termed the
     **Default Route**, and it means the default route (to "the rest of" the
     internet). See :rfc:`1700`.
     For example::
         0.0.0.0/8
         ::/128

   Loopback Address
     Reserved for loopback and IPC on the localhost. See :rfc:`1122`.
     Example::
         127.0.0.0

   Localhost Address
     Loopback IP addresses (refers to self). See :rfc:`5735`.
     Examples include::
         127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254   (127.0.0.0/8)
         ::1

   Link-Local Address
     These are the link-local blocks, used for communication between hosts on
     a single link. See :rfc:`3927`.
     Examples::
         169.254.0.0/16
         fe80::/64

   Multicast Address
     Reserved for multicast addresses. See :rfc:`3171`.
     For example::
         224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (224.0.0.0/4)

   Private Address
     Reserved for private networks. See :rfc:`1918`.
     Some examples include::
         10.0.0.0/8
         172.16.0.0/12
         192.168.0.0/16

   Reserved Address
     Reserved (former Class E network). See :rfc:`1700`, :rfc:`3232`, and
     :rfc:`5735`. The one exception to this rule is the :term:`Limited
     Broadcast Address`, ``255.255.255.255`` for which packets at the IP
     layer are not forwarded to the public internet. For example::
         240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (240.0.0.0/4)

   Limited Broadcast Address
     Limited broadcast address (limited to all other nodes on the LAN). See
     :rfc:`919`. For IPv4, ``255`` in any part of the IP is reserved for
     broadcast addressing to the local LAN, e.g.::
         255.255.255.255


.. warning:: The :mod:`ipaddr` module (as of version 2.1.10) does not
             understand the following reserved_ addresses:
.. _reserved: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735#page-4

.. glossary::

   Reserved Address (Protocol Assignments)
     Reserved for IETF protocol assignments. See :rfc:`5735`.
     Example::
         192.0.0.0/24

   Reserved Address (6to4 Relay Anycast)
     IPv6 to IPv4 relay. See :rfc:`3068`.
     Example::
         192.88.99.0/24

   Reserved Address (Network Benchmark)
     Network benchmark tests. See :rfc:`2544`.
     Example::
         198.18.0.0/15

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-1)
     Reserved for use in documentation and example code. It is often used in
     conjunction with domain names ``example.com`` or ``example.net`` in
     vendor and protocol documentation. See :rfc:`1166`.
     For example::
         192.0.2.0/24

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-2)
     TEST-NET-2. See :rfc:`5737`.
     Example::
         198.51.100.0/24

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-3)
     TEST-NET-3. See :rfc:`5737`.
     Example::
         203.0.113.0/24

   Shared Address Space
     See :rfc:`6598`.
     Example::
         100.64.0.0/10

   Site-Local Address
   Unique Local Address
     Similar uses to :term:`Limited Broadcast Address`. For IPv6, everything
     becomes convoluted_ and complicated_, and then redefined_. See
     :rfc:`4193`, :rfc:`3879`, and :rfc:`3513`. The
     :meth:`ipaddr.IPAddress.is_site_local` method *only* checks to see if
     the address is a **Unique Local Address** vis-á-vis :rfc:`3513` §2.5.6,
     e.g.::
         ff00::0/8
         fec0::/10
