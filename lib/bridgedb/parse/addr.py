Private IP Address Ranges:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
.. glossary::

   10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  (10.0.0.0/8 prefix)
   172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  (172.16.0.0/12 prefix)
   192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16 prefix)
      These Address ranges are reserved by IANA for private intranets, and not
      routable to the Internet.  For additional information, see :rfc:`1918`.

Reserved and Special Use Addresses:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
.. glossary::

   Unspecified Address
   Default Route
      ex. ``0.0.0.0/8``
      ex. ``::/128``
      Current network (only valid as source address). See :rfc:`1122`. An
      **Unspecified Address** in the context of firewalls means "all addresses
      of the local machine". In a routing context, it is usually termed the
      **Default Route**, and it means the default route (to "the rest of" the
      internet). See :rfc:`1700`.

   Loopback Address
      ex. ``127.0.0.0``
      Reserved for loopback and IPC on the localhost. See :rfc:`1122`.

   Localhost Address
      ex. ``127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254`` (``127.0.0.0/8``)
      ex. ``::1``
      Loopback IP addresses (refers to self). See :rfc:`5735`.

   Link-Local Address
      ex. ``169.254.0.0/16``
      ex. ``fe80::/64``
      These are the link-local blocks, used for communication between hosts on
      a single link. See :rfc:`3927`.

   Multicast Address
      ex. ``224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255`` (``224.0.0.0/4``)
      Reserved for multicast addresses. See :rfc:`3171`.

   Private Address
      ex. ``10.0.0.0/8``
      ex. ``172.16.0.0/12``
      ex. ``192.168.0.0/16``
      Reserved for private networks. See :rfc:`1918`.

   Reserved Address
      ex. ``240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255`` (``240.0.0.0/4``)
      Reserved (former Class E network). See :rfc:`1700`, :rfc:`3232`, and
      :rfc:`5735`. The one exception to this rule is the :term:`Limited
      Broadcast Address`, ``255.255.255.255`` for which packets at the IP
      layer are not forwarded to the public internet.

   Limited Broadcast Address
      ex. ``255.255.255.255``
      Limited broadcast address (limited to all other nodes on the LAN). See
      :rfc:`919`. For IPv4, ``255`` in any part of the IP is reserved for
      broadcast addressing to the local LAN.


.. warning:: The :mod:`ipaddr` module (as of version 2.1.10) does not
             understand the following reserved_ addresses:

.. _reserved: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735#page-4

.. glossary::

   Reserved Address (Protocol Assignments)
      ex. ``192.0.0.0/24``
      Reserved for IETF protocol assignments. See :rfc:`5735`.

   Reserved Address (6to4 Relay Anycast)
      ex. ``192.88.99.0/24``
      IPv6 to IPv4 relay. See :rfc:`3068`.

   Reserved Address (Network Benchmark)
      ex. ``198.18.0.0/15``
      Network benchmark tests. See :rfc:`2544`.

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-1)
      ex. ``192.0.2.0/24``
      Reserved for use in documentation and example code. It is often used in
      conjunction with domain names ``example.com`` or ``example.net`` in
      vendor and protocol documentation. See :rfc:`1166`.

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-2)
      ex. ``198.51.100.0/24``
      TEST-NET-2. See :rfc:`5737`.

   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-3)
      ex. ``203.0.113.0/24``
      TEST-NET-3. See :rfc:`5737`.

   Shared Address Space
      ex. ``100.64.0.0/10``
      See :rfc:`6598`.

   Site-Local Address
   Unique Local Address
      ex. ``ff00::0/8``
      ex. ``fec0::/10`` (:rfc:`3513` ยง2.5.6)
      Similar uses to :term:`Limited Broadcast Address`. For IPv6, everything
      becomes convoluted_ and complicated_, and then redefined_. See
      :rfc:`4193`, :rfc:`3879`, and :rfc:`3513`. The
      :meth:`ipaddr.IPAddress.is_site_local` method *only* checks to see if
      the address is a **Unique Local Address** vis-รก-vis :rfc:`3513` ยง2.5.6.
