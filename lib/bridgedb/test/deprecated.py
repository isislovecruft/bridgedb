        Pluggable transports are described within a bridge's ``@type
        bridge-extrainfo`` descriptor, see the ``Specifications: Client
        behavior`` section and the ``TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS``
        description in pt-spec.txt_ for additional specification.

        :type bridge: :class:`Bridge`
        :param bridge: The parent bridge running this pluggable transport
            instance, i.e. the main ORPort bridge whose
            ``@type bridge-server-descriptor`` contains a hash digest for a
            ``@type bridge-extrainfo-document``, the latter of which contains
            the parameter of this pluggable transport in its ``transport``
            line.

        :param str methodname: The canonical "name" for this pluggable
            transport, i.e. the one which would be specified in a torrc
            file. For example, ``"obfs2"``, ``"obfs3"``, ``"scramblesuit"``
            would all be pluggable transport method names.

        :param str address: The IP address of the transport. Currently (as of
            20 March 2014), there are no known, widely-deployed pluggable
            transports which support IPv6. Ergo, this is very likely going to
            be an IPv4 address.

        :param int port: A integer specifying the port which this pluggable
            transport is listening on. (This should likely be whatever port the
            bridge specified in its ``ServerTransportPlugin`` torrc line,
            unless the pluggable transport is running in "managed" mode.)

        :param dict argdict: Some PTs can take additional arguments, which
            must be distributed to the client out-of-band. These are present
            in the ``@type bridge-extrainfo-document``, in the ``transport``
            line like so::

                METHOD SP ADDR ":" PORT SP [K=V[,K=V[,K=V[â€¦]]]]

            where K is the **argdict** key, and V is the value. For example,
            in the case of ``scramblesuit``, for which the client must supply
            a shared secret to the ``scramblesuit`` instance running on the
            bridge, the **argdict** would be something like::
