  bridgesPerResponse() property      FORMERLY getNumBridgesPerAnswer()
  hashring struct     FORMERLY KNOWN AS splitter

DistributionContext {  # should go in bridgedb.py
    distributors {
        name: DistributorContext
    }
}

DistributorContext {   # should go in bridgedb.py
    name str
    allocationPercentage property
    publicKey

Hashring {
    assignBridgesToSubrings()   FORMERLY bridgedb.filters.assignBridgesToSubring()
        + filters bridges uniformly into subrings
    clear() / __del__()
    isEmpty property
}

MAYBE
-----
mapClientToHashring() FORMERLY KNOWN AS areaMapper AND
mapClientToSubhashring()
authenticateToBridgeDB()
maintainACL() for proxylists

- need a way for BridgeDB to decide global parameters to be followed
  by all distributors.  
      - BridgeAnswerParameters?
        maybe call it DistributionContext?
        then have DistributorContexts?

  requiredFlags  AnswerParameters?
  requireFlag()
  requiredPorts
  requirePorts()

  THINGS NEEDED FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DISTRIBUTORS AND BRIDGEDB
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  * distributorCredential (for authenticating to the DB)
  * metrics?
      * total clients seen
      * total clients served
      - unique clients seen
      - unique clients served
      * total requests for TRANSPORT
      * total times TRANSPORT was served

  THINGS DISTRIBUTORS SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF, BUT NOT REPORT
  --------------------------------------------------------
  - approximate bridge bandwidth
  - approximate bandwidth per client
  - approximate bridge bandwidth already distributed

  NAMES FOR CHOOSING "GET ME WHATEVER TRANSPORTS"
  -----------------------------------------------
  chocolate box, russian roulette

  * How much of a bad idea would it be to store bridges allocated to a
    distributor as diffs over the last time the Distributor asked?
