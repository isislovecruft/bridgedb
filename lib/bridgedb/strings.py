"""``EMAIL_SPRINTF`` is a dictionary that maps translated strings which
contain format specifiers (i.e. ``%s``) to what those format specifiers should
be replaced with in a given template system.

For example, a string which needs a pair of HTML ``("<a href=''">, "</a>")``
tags (for the templates used by :mod:`bridgedb.HTTPServer`) would need some
alternative replacements for the :mod:`EmailServer`, because the latter uses
templates with a ``text/plain`` mimetype instead of HTML. For the
``EmailServer``, the format strings specifiers are replaced with an empty
string where the opening ``<a>`` tags would go, and a numbered Markdown link
specifier where the closing ``</a>`` tags would go.

The keys in this dictionary are the Python variable names of the corresponding
strings which are being formatted, i.e. ``WELCOME0`` would be the string
replacements for ``strings.WELCOME.get(0)``.


For example, the ``0`` string in :data:`WELCOME` above has the substring::

    "%s without Pluggable Transport %s"

and so to replace the two ``%s`` format specifiers, you would use this mapping
like so::

>>> from bridgedb import strings
>>> welcome = strings.WELCOME[0] % strings.EMAIL_SPRINTF["WELCOME0"]
>>> print welcome.split('\n')[0]
BridgeDB can provide bridges with several types of Pluggable Transports[0],
